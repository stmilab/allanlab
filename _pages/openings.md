# Openeings

Thank you for visiting this page and for your interest. I am looking for highly motivated students to help grow my research group! This means research opportunities for those students excited about working in a unique, interdisciplinary realm of research and application. While I have listed some specifics here, we are always looking for bright, motivated students that cross all our fields of research from embedded systems design to machine learning and clinical outcomes research (including MD-PhD students admitted to the TAMU Health Science Program)

**Opening 1: Looking for highly motivated PhD students that are interested in end-to-end systems designs to implement real-time diagnostic tools and applications of data mining and machine learning modeling.**

**Opening 2: Looking for highly motivated MS students that are interested in the implementation and data collection experience with sensor fusion, based on smartwatch and smartphone platforms.**

**Why Our Group?** We aim to provide cutting edge personal health research by combining the development of new sensors with machine learning techniques on real medical outcomes research problems. A unique, interdisciplinary group that will focus research on personalized sensing, machine learning, and fitness/well-being with clinical applications that span the spectrum from personalized medicine to population health analytics and tools. This group will conduct research at the unique intersection of interdisciplinary work in medical outcomes research, machine learning applications, and embedded systems design.

**Why Texas A&M?** Texas A&M is a tier one university and a major research institution. The engineering school ranks among top 10 public schools in the US according to the US News & World Report rankings. The University has world-class faculty, major research programs, and a significant amount of resources. But more importantly, Texas A&M attracts some of the best students interested in engineering disciplines and has a very strong alumni network. The engineering school is going under transformational programs including the 25 by 25 initiative which aims to increase access for qualified students to engineering education to an enrollment of 25,000 engineering students by 2025. This can potentially transform the Texas A&M engineering school to the largest engineering program in the US.

**Prospective PhD Students not yet admitted to Texas A&M:** Thank you for your interest! Our engineering program is highly competitive and selective, and only the most qualified candidates will be admitted. I have no control over the admission. Once you realize there is a mutual match, send me an email! Please avoid sending generic emails. Include your CV, transcripts, TOEFL (if you are an international student) and GRE scores (if available) and a brief description on a project that you have done and you are proud of. Once again, although I have no control over the admission after we set up an interview and get to know each other better, I may add my recommendation to your admission file.

**PhD Students in Texas A&M:** Congrats on the admission to our graduate program. I always have openings for motivated and talented graduate students. As this is a new group, you will gain vast experience in researching and managing interdisciplinary projects that span the realm of systems and sensors design to medical analytic applications. I encourage you to read through my existing projects on the research page, maybe browse through some of the papers, and send me an email. Please include your CV, transcripts, TOEFL (if you are an international student) and GRE scores and a brief description on a project that you have done and you are proud of. I do not think GPA is always a definite indicator on the research capabilities of the student, I would, however, pay attention to your grades in key engineering courses. Publications (top or good quality) often are very important indicators of your research capabilities.

**MS Students in Texas A&M:** Occasionally, when there is a perfect match and a project is suitable for an MS thesis, there might be opportunities for an RA. If you are interested in my research, I suggest that you take my upcoming graduate course in medical systems.

**Undergraduate Students in Texas A&M:** I will be looking to add undergraduate students to my group, and if you are interested, please read some of my papers and send me an email with your CV, transcript, and particular interests. Note, however, as I am starting a new group, the workload might be high, though the likelihood of publications will hopefully be increased.

**Undergraduate Students not in Texas A&M:** I do not have any position for undergraduate students not enrolled in Texas A&M. This includes internship opportunities (paid or unpaid).
