## About Me

#### Sicong stole the followings from this [website](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~bm598/#bio)

Since 2017, I'm an Associate Professor in Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University, as a memeber of the Center for Remote Health Technologies & Systems. I am currently an Instructor in Cardiology at the Yale University School of Medicine. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral associate under the supervision of Prof. Harlan Krumholz at the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) and Prof. Sahand Negahban of the Department of Statistics. I worked as a graduate student (and earned my Ph.D.) in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Majid Sarrafzadeh at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Wireless Health Institute (2014). I earned a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Univeristy of California Berkeley (2007).

My research interests include end-to-end research on medical embedded systems and the application of data mining and machine learning algorithms necessary to make personalized, preventative medical treatments possible through advanced health analytics . My background is in embedded systems design, where I studied sensor fusion, reconfigurable architectures and systems, hardware accelerators, and gpu computing. During my Ph.D. I applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these systems to develop a personalized, exercise-level activity-recognition video game with wearable sensors. I am now primarily concerned with the ability to use supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn more about medical prediction and risk-stratification in order to better develop personalized medical systems, prediction models, comparative effectiveness techniques, and combine wearable sensors and other necessary data to make a clinical impact at the system level, provider level, and patient level.
