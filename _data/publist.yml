- title: "Multimodal Pretraining of Medical Time Series and Notes"
  image: ryan_ml4h23.png
  description: Within the intensive care unit (ICU), a wealth of patient data, including clinical measurements and clinical notes, is readily available. This data is a valuable resource for comprehending patient health and informing medical decisions, but it also contains many challenges in analysis. Deep learning models show promise in extracting meaningful patterns, but they require extensive labeled data, a challenge in critical care. To address this, we propose a novel approach employing self-supervised pretraining, focusing on the alignment of clinical measurements and notes. Our approach combines contrastive and masked token prediction tasks during pretraining. Semi-supervised experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised pretraining. In downstream tasks, including in-hospital mortality prediction and phenotyping, our pretrained model outperforms baselines in settings where only a fraction of the data is labeled, emphasizing its ability to enhance ICU data analysis. Notably, our method excels in situations where very few labels are available, as evidenced by an increase in the AUC-ROC for in-hospital mortality by 0.17 and in AUC-PR for phenotyping by 0.1 when only 1% of labels are accessible. This work advances self-supervised learning in the healthcare domain, optimizing clinical insights from abundant yet challenging ICU data.

- title: "BoXHED2.0: Scalable Boosting of Dynamic Survival Analysis"
  image: arash_jss23.png
  description: Modern applications of survival analysis increasingly involve time-dependent covariates. The Python package BoXHED2.0 is a tree-boosted hazard estimator that is fully nonparametric, and is applicable to survival settings far more general than right-censoring, including recurring events and competing risks. BoXHED2.0 is also scalable to the point of being on the same order of speed as parametric boosted survival models, in part because its core is written in C++ and it also supports the use of GPUs and multicore CPUs. BoXHED2.0 is available from PyPI and also from www.github.com/BoXHED.

- title: "Variational Autoencoders for Biomedical Signal Morphology Clustering and Noise Detection"
  image: zhale_jbhi23.png
  description: Accurate estimation of physiological biomarkers using raw waveform data from non-invasive wearable devices requires extensive data preprocessing. An automatic noise detection method in time-series data would offer significant utility for various domains. As data labeling is onerous, having a minimally supervised abnormality detection method for input data, as well as an estimation of the severity of the signal corruptness, is essential. We propose a model-free, time-series biomedical waveform noise detection framework using a Variational Autoencoder coupled with Gaussian Mixture Models, which can detect a range of waveform abnormalities without annotation, providing a confidence metric for each segment. Our technique operates on biomedical signals that exhibit periodicity of heart activities. This framework can be applied to any machine learning or deep learning model as an initial signal validator component. Moreover, the confidence score generated by the proposed framework can be incorporated into different models' optimization to construct confidence-aware modeling. We conduct experiments using dynamic time warping (DTW) distance of segments to validated cardiac cycle morphology. The result confirms that our approach removes noisy cardiac cycles and the remaining signals, classified as clean, exhibit a 59.92% reduction in the standard deviation of DTW distances. Using a dataset of bio-impedance data of 97885 cardiac cycles, we further demonstrate a significant improvement in the downstream task of cuffless blood pressure estimation, with an average reduction of 2.67 mmHg root mean square error (RMSE) of Diastolic Blood pressure and 2.13 mmHg RMSE of systolic blood pressure, with increases of average Pearson correlation of 0.28 and 0.08, with a statistically significant improvement of signal-to-noise ratio respectively in the presence of different synthetic noise sources. This enables burden-free validation of wearable sensor data for downstream biomedical applications.

- title: "Clinical Phenotyping with an Outcomes-driven Mixture of Experts for Patient Matching and Risk Estimation"
  image:
  description: Accurate and continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for clinical hemodynamic monitoring. However, current methods are either invasive, requiring insertion of catheters, or provide limited information, lacking comprehensive ABP waveforms. Cuffless wearable solutions, combined with deep learning, offer potential but face challenges in accurately reconstructing ABP waveforms and estimating systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) due to individual variability. We propose a custom pre-trained backbone and a tailored optimization function to address these challenges. Our method demonstrates superior performance in ABP waveform reconstruction and accurate SBP/DBP estimations, while significantly reducing subject variance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comprehensive evaluations using both in-clinic data and a pioneering study involving remote health monitoring with cuffless data. Our results surpass previous efforts, demonstrating a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.41 ± 1.35 mmHg and a minimum of 58% lower standard deviation (SD) across all measurements. These outcomes highlight the robustness and precision of our method in accurately estimating SBP/DBP and reconstructing ABP waveforms. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of our solution in non-clinical settings using the CTRAL BioZ dataset. The evaluation yielded an RMSE of 8.66 ± 1.13 mmHg for ABP, proving the potential of ABP reconstruction under remote health settings.

- title: "Earlier identification of hypertensive events in a telemonitoring system"
  image:
  description: Hypertension is a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. Telemonitoring can be used to provide a communication pipeline between patients and clinicians for diagnosing hypertension and staging early intervention. However, it takes healthcare resources to monitor patients and identify patients at risk of experiencing a hypertensive event. To reduce the burden on the health care system, we present an automated early warning system to predict patients at risk of a hypertensive event. We first construct a fusion model that utilizes a dual stage attention mechanism to determine whether a hypertensive event occurs in the next seven days and compare its performance to XGBoost and logistic regression. Then, we measure its performance in an early warning system to determine whether it can detect the onset of the first hypertensive event for each patient. With the best threshold, the early warning system using this model has an F1 score of 0.61.

- title: "Modeling the effect of non-exercise activity on peak post-prandial glucose in diabetes"
  image:
  description: The timing, intensity, and duration of postprandial exercise are important factors that reduce glucose excursions. When exercise is of moderate intensity, performed between 25 and 55 minutes after a meal, it results in greater attenuation of glucose. However, the potential glucose reduction for shorter-duration, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) (such as activities of daily living) may also be beneficial, particularly in cases where exercise is neither feasible nor prudent. Therefore, we designed a system to capture blood glucose and activity intensity through internet of medical things devices and modeled the impact of the timing and duration of NEAT on peak glucose. This work designed a linear mixed effects model to evaluate the impact of NEAT on peak, postprandial glucose in a study of data captured on varied participants with or without diabetes. We found at least 25 minutes of NEAT starting 30 minutes after the meal most effectively reduced peak post-prandial glucose.Clinical Relevance— This work establishes the impact of NEAT on reducing post-prandial peak glucose in free-living environments as another method of controlling glucose surges.

- title: "Joint Embedding of Food Photographs and Blood Glucose for Improved Calorie Estimation"
  image: lida_bhi23.png
  description: Type 2 diabetes has a significant impact on individuals health and well-being, and diet monitoring is an important tool in treating individuals. Accurate estimation of meal intake is essential for promoting diet and behavior interventions. While continuous glucose models (CGMs) have demonstrated the ability to estimate carbohydrate quantities in meals, CGMs-alone have been insufficient in capturing other meal nutritional information due to the different types of food and people’s health conditions. Therefore, we propose a multi-modality model for augmenting CGM-based inverse metabolic models by using both CGMcaptured interstitial glucose data and food image data. A late fusion approach is used to aggregate the extracted glucose information from the attention-based Transformer and Gaussian area under the curve (gAUC) features, and image information from the vision transformer. We test our model on a dataset collecting Freestyle Libre Pro CGM data and meal photographs of breakfasts and lunches on 27 participants, with meals with known fixed caloric content. Our joint embedded approach to learning calorie estimations from both CGM data and image data achieved an average Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.34 for calorie prediction, with a correlation of 0.52, a 15.0% improvement over CGM-only models and 17.1% over image-only models.

- title: "Clinical Risk Prediction Models with Meta-Learning Prototypes of Patient Heterogeneity"
  image:
  description: Hospitalized patients sometimes have complex health conditions, such as multiple diseases, underlying diseases, and complications. The heterogeneous patient conditions may have various representations. A generalized model ignores the differences among heterogeneous patients, and personalized models, even with transfer learning, are still limited to the small amount of training data and the repeated training process. Meta-learning provides a solution for training similar patients based on few-shot learning; however, cannot address common cross-domain patients. Inspired by prototypical networks [1], we proposed a meta-prototype for Electronic Health Records (EHR), a meta-learning-based model with flexible prototypes representing the heterogeneity in patients. We apply this technique to cardiovascular diseases in MIMIC-III and compare it against a set of benchmark models, and demonstrate its ability to address heterogeneous patient health conditions and improve the model performances from 1.2% to 11.9% on different metrics and prediction tasks.Clinical relevance— Developing an adaptive EHR risk prediction model for outcomes-driven phenotyping of heterogeneous patient health conditions.

- title: "Semi-supervised Meta-learning for Multi-source Heterogeneity in Time-series Data"
  image: lida_mlhc23.png
  description: Real-world time-series data is riddled with heterogeneity that is often present across a number of dataset dimensions, features, labels, and time-varying factors. The heterogeneity in time-series data may be raised by introducing new features, missing data, and domain shifts in the feature dimension, and the difficulty of collecting promising ground truth results in label uncertainty. In addition, the variation on the time manner further aggravates the complexity of data heterogeneity, since the features and labels may change on the same sequence of data over time. Many machine learning techniques have been proposed to address the data heterogeneity, including transfer learning, meta-learning, semi-supervised learning, recurrent networks, etc. However, each of these techniques is limited to one type of heterogeneity. In this study, we seek to create adaptable models for the multi-source heterogeneity in time-series data. We propose a semi-supervised-based meta-learning (SSML) with an adversarial training mechanism simultaneously addressing the heterogeneous features and labeling uncertainty, a time domain variation (TDV) framework to apply SSML and transfer learning for the third level of data heterogeneity. We test our models on two medical datasets, PhysioNet Challenge 2012 and MIMIC-III ICU dataset, and improve over all benchmark models.

- title: "Density-Aware Personalized Training for Risk Prediction in Imbalanced Medical Data"
  image: zepeng_mlhc22.png
  description: Medical events of interest, such as mortality, often happen at a low rate in electronic medical records, as most admitted patients survive. Training models with this imbalance rate (class density discrepancy) may lead to suboptimal prediction. Traditionally this problem is addressed through ad-hoc methods such as resampling or reweighting but performance in many cases is still limited. We propose a framework for training models for this imbalance issue:1) we first decouple the feature extraction and classification process, adjusting training batches separately for each component to mitigate bias caused by class density discrepancy; 2) we train the network with both a density-aware loss and a learnable cost matrix for misclassifications. We demonstrate our model’s improved performance in real-world medical datasets (TOPCAT and MIMIC-III) to show improved AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, Brier Skill Score compared with the baselines in the domain.

- title: "Developing Personalized Models of Blood Pressure Estimation with Wearable Sensors Using Minimally-Trained Domain Adversarial Neural Networks"
  image: DevelopingPersonalizedModels.png
  description: Blood pressure monitoring is an essential component of hypertension management and in the prediction of associated comorbidities. Blood pressure is a dynamic vital sign with frequent changes throughout a given day. Capturing blood pressure remotely and frequently (also known as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) has traditionally been achieved by measuring blood pressure at discrete intervals using an inflatable cuff. However, there is growing interest in developing a cuffless ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system to measure blood pressure continuously. One such approach is by utilizing bioimpedance sensors to build regression models. A practical problem with this approach is that the amount of data required to confidently train such a regression model can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose the application of the domain-adversarial training neural network (DANN) method on our multitask learning (MTL) blood pressure estimation model, allowing for knowledge transfer between subjects.

  description: Problem lists are intended to provide clinicians with a relevant summary of patient medical issues and are embedded in many electronic health record systems. Despite their importance, problem lists are often cluttered with resolved or currently irrelevant conditions. In this work, we develop a novel end-to-end framework that first extracts diagnosis and procedure information from clinical notes and subsequently uses the extracted medical problems to predict patient outcomes

- title: "BoXHED: Boosted eXact Hazard Estimator with Dynamic covariates"
  image: BoXHED.png
  description: The proliferation of medical monitoring devices makes it possible to track health vitals at high frequency, enabling the development of dynamic health risk scores that change with the underlying readings. Survival analysis, in particular hazard estimation, is well-suited to analyzing this stream of data to predict disease onset as a function of the time-varying vitals. This paper introduces the software package BoXHED (pronounced `box-head') for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosting

- title: "Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Context-Aware Mobile Activity Recognition and Unknown Context Discovery"
  image: UncertaintyQuantification.png
  description: For activity recognition, the traditional methods would omit the whereabouts of the users, i.e. the context. We aim to make use of context information as a guidance to do finer-grained activity recognition. Furthermore, the model is coupled with an uncertainty quantification mechanism to reject unknown context to make sure the prediction is robust
